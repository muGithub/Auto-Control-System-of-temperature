# Auto-Control-System-of-temperature

## IDE: MDK 5
## Method: Before we prepared hardwares of "temperature control system", we should use MDK 5 softwares to download Hex file of this project into STM32F103zet6,
## The function of this project: When we set a number between 20-50 ℃, This system can work automatically to keep the environment temperature around the number,
## The result: The best situation could make the temperature error less than 0.2℃ in a experiment environment.
